# Sleep_Calculator
The Sleep Calculator program in Python helps users find optimal sleep and wake-up times to avoid waking during REM cycles. Users can choose to enter a sleep time or use the current time, and the program suggests wake-up or sleep times based on 90-minute cycles. The interactive program continues until the user decides to exit.
